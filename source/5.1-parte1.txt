Part 1: Advocacy for social change, protection, justice and accountability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, some argue that there are a few overarching
reasons to create and use documentation:
1. To bring about an outcome related to some form of “change” (whether for a particular case or for social justice, generally)
2. To protect women human rights defenders
3. To seek justice, and
4. To seek accountability through telling the truth about violations.

Together and individually, these categories help to shape advocacy choices of WHRDs. Good documen-
tation is the foundation of all of these objectives.

1. The idea of using documentation to create change is far reaching, and is simply based in eliciting a change in circumstances or in understanding, whether related to safety, attitudes, policies, or the climate surround-ing activism. Documenting for human rights-related purposes implies that something is wrong, and the status quo is not good enough.

2. Protection of WHRDs refers to putting in place “systems” to prevent future or additional abuses.
Protection can take many forms: it can be preventive and “future-based”, or designed to address
someone immediately at risk. It can include various forms of security, including those related to physical and psycho-social well-being and even longer-term economic safety.

3. The common understanding of justice is a rooted in building a world based on fairness and equity. In a legal sense, “justice” incorporates ideas based on the principle of punishment for any wrong inflicted on another. So for most violations of rights, the remedy (or “solution”) has been to make a formal complaint with police or other official “body”, file a case, and undergo litigation to prove that the violation was committed by the alleged perpetrator, with a judge
or jury finally punishing the wrongdoer.

However, feminists have argued that demands related to gender-sensitive and gender-responsive
justice go far beyond punishment of perpetrators. They argue that justice for women and WHRDs could
or should include more than remedies from courts or judicial systems. Some of these demands include:
the prioritizing of protection from and prevention of further abuses, and redress, including compensation (or other reparations), and, in the framework of transitional justice^63, reconciliation and healing.

4. Justice implies and requires having mechanisms of accountability to prevent and punish violations
and abuses, and the provision of remedies to those affected. Accountability, on an informal level, can be defined as taking responsibility for one’s actions; it is also closely related to the process of seeking that responsibility from others, providing recourse or remedy for and to those negatively affected for harms and undertaking appropriate corrective action. Under international human rights law, States are directly accountable for any violation resulting from State action or policy within their territories^64.

In addition, governments are ultimately accountable for abuses committed by non-State or private actors, including family and community members and corporate actors, where there is lack of diligence on their part to prevent, control, or punish violations or to protect human rights. Of course, non-State actors are directly accountable, as well, through national and sometimes international criminal law. Accountability can also be enforced through non-legal means and
through traditional justice mechanisms.

If a harm is done to women human rights defenders, the person, people and institutions who are responsible ought to be held accountable.

# Deciding what to do with documentation

Good documentation creates opportunities to demand outcomes in different arenas. It supports
a range of uses and goals, sometimes simultaneously. Documentation can be “repackaged” and
used for different “sites” of advocacy, a range of audiences and to build wider coalitions. Therefore, far from choosing just one strategy, activists should look to using documentation to support multiple creative tactics.

Advocates must continually think about the best strategy or forum to access, given our assessments of our objectives, capacity, expertise and the risks faced. Some of the considerations advocates need to consider in deciding how to use documentation include:

//////////
[^63]: Transitional justice generally is concerned about legacies of “massive human rights abuses” and can include systems that are put into place in the aftermath of contexts of conflict and state repression.
[^64]: There are obligations for States to ensure their actions do no human rights harm beyond their territories, as well. For a current discussion and more information about accountability and justice, see OHCHR and the Center for Economic and Social Rights, Who will be Accountable: human rights and the post-2015 development agenda (2013).

CASE STUDY
The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya (GALCK) with activists from Minority Women in Action (MWA), another Kenyan activist group, created a detailed country report in which they documented realities
of lesbians’ lives in Kenya, with a grounding in an analysis about bodily autonomy.

After activists crafted the documentation, which included both concerns and strategies, they easily repackaged the content for use as a shadow report submission to the African Commission. The advantage of this recrafting was to make documentation come alive for different uses, audiences and outcomes. They developed the entire project so it could be immediately applied to organizing once the initial documentation was done. Besides having a paper trail of lived realities—the “product”
can be used for media campaigns, for lobbying, to make presentations to churches and other religious groups or for any other strategic purposes.

///////////

## WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES/GOALS?
As outlined above and in previous chapters, there are many different ways documentation can be used to meet particular objectives. Clearly defining the objective and desired outcome of any use of documentation is essential to ensuring choosing the best strategy, tactics and sites to meet those goals.

The ability to share the narratives of women human rights defenders with accuracy and in a timely way underpins all of these efforts, whether the desired outcomes are about reducing immediate threats, changing a policy, or creating long-term attitude change.

Defining the objectives or goals of advocacy ought to be determined by what is seen as strategic and feasible at the time^65. This process should also place the concerns, demands and desires of WHRDs and the contexts in which we work at the centre of decision-making.

Also, since situations can change rapidly for defenders, including risks to security, it is vital that those documenting reassess circumstances at various times and remain in close communication with those whose experiences are being addressed. Some situations call for flexibility and modifying advocacy strategies as time passes and as circumstances change.


## WHAT IMPACT DOES THE CONTEXT AND ENVIRONMENT HAVE ON WHRDS’ ADVOCACY CHOICES?

As explored in previous chapters, context and environment can have a significant impact on—or even
determine—what WHRDs can do with documentation and what can be effectively achieved through advo-
cacy. 66 Extremely hostile political climates, or election cycles, for instance, may expand or limit the choices that defenders make.

Contexts may determine whether more public or more “underground” strategies are chosen. For
instance, if advocacy is grounded in defending rights of people whose behaviour or identities are criminalised, such as sex workers or LGBT people, defenders may choose certain strategies over others in order to avoid immediate arrest^68. When WHRDs are criminalized, certain factors must be taken into account^69. What if the goal of using documentation is to decriminalise a group’s behaviour or identity—but those defenders are more likely to be arrested in the process of seeking justice because of the legal context? How are different advocacy decisions made when the real or perceived identity or behaviour of the defenders involved places them immediately at risk of detention—simply because of who they are seen to be?

///////////

CASE STUDY
In 2012, in Uganda, police raided a Drop In Centre of the Women’s Organization Network for Human Rights Advocacy (WONETHA), a group that defends rights of sex workers and provides information
on sexual and reproductive health. Police arrested two staff and confiscated documents, computers and other materials. Sex work is illegal in Uganda, although providing services for sex workers is not. Police have engaged in various forms of harassment, claiming that all activities related to
sex work are illegal^67.

### GUIDING QUESTIONS
• How are risk assessments made more complicated than in other situations? What other things must
be taken into account?
• How is coalition work or solidarity affected? Are defenders in these situations more likely to have partners in advocacy? Less?
• How can allies provide support when they are placed at risk as well (e.g., health providers who
will not expose HIV+ status of their clients where transmission is criminalized, or who will protect
sex workers by not naming them to police)?
• How are decisions about security made when arrests are likely because of a law that criminal­izes identities and expressions of sexuality or gender, rather than any advocacy actions the defenders take?
• What are the implications for confidentiality of defenders in these circumstances?
• How are media strategies affected in these cases, when any exposure creates immediate risk, and especially if there is a close relationship between the media and the government?

/////////////

## WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF DIFFERENT ADVOCACY “SITES” OR MECHANISMS?

Many kinds of social justice organizations are struggling in the current global political context. Restrictions on civil society organizing are rampant in the global South and North, with one estimate revealing that since 2013, over 60 countries have passed or introduced legislation that limits NGO activity^71. Human rights defenders are increasingly facing challenges to advocacy, with governments finding ever more creative ways to create restrictions on dissent and political engagement. Of course, this poses an added layer of challenge for women human rights defenders, as women’s, human rights, and sexual and reproductive rights groups are often caught in this dragnet, and as WHRDs as individuals face additional risks and harassment.

In a world of limited resources for activism, WHRDs must make smart decisions about where we choose to make our claims. Not all places for advocacy will be equally beneficial or equally challenging.

[^68]: Laws may criminalize identity directly, or defenders’ appearance or advocacy. Laws related to “public scandal” or “public decency” are also used to arrest those who are seen to be defying gender norms. Women wearing mini-skirts are sometimes harassed or arrested, as well.

[^69]: There are similarities in terms of reproductive rights as well, especially in the context of providers of abortion services where abortion is illegal.

///////////////

###GUIDING QUESTIONS FOR ASSESSING ADVOCACY SITES:

• What is the history with that particular site of advocacy, or mechanism? Has it received in­ formation on women human rights defenders before? If yes, was the outcome useful? Is there an immediate possibility for future constructive outcomes?

• How open are decision-makers within that space to new human rights ideas, or to women’s human
rights, or to defenders generally?

• What is the coalition building potential? Do ally groups work in the space under consideration?
What kind of experiences have they had?

• Are there risks of using that mechanism, whether in relation to safety, exposure or negative politi­cal outcomes, including reprisals?

• What are the potential costs—whether financial or otherwise?

///////////////

Activists creating and using documentation must remember that, whatever their chosen strategies, they may be relying on systems that can be hostile, or that are sometimes seen to fail women. Using documentation for political and cultural outcomes is courageous, and often entails seeking long-term change as much as it also entails seeking more immediate justice and accountability in a particular case. That kind of longterm engagement in these spaces can require tenacity.

One critical concern is that women human rights defenders must assess at the local level the socio-
political and economic impacts as well as advantages and disadvantages of engaging with U.N. and regional mechanisms—and the risks or opportunities that international engagement can bring. For example, in some cases, defenders at risk within a particular country may be placed in additional danger if their cases are publicised at the international level. Additionally, it might impede their ability to leave their countries to move to safer places if their governments are informed that they have been in touch with U.N. experts. This could lead to other activists, organizations or movements being penalized.

CASE STUDY
In an interview published by The Guardian UK newspaper, Sri Lankan women’s rights activist Nimalka Fernando refers to challenges she faced after participating in U.N. activities. “And the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, in one of the programmes, titled [it] ‘Stoning the Sinner Woman’ because I spoke about the rights of sex workers, I spoke about the manner in which we have the right to go and work in the U.N. openly, transparently. They discussed the ways and means of how to kill us, kill me and kill other human rights defenders while cooperating with the U.N”^72.

////////////

CASE STUDY
The following text is from a March 2014 press release issued by several U.N. Special Procedures about the death of Chinese activist and WHRD Cao Shunli.

A group of U.N. experts today expressed their dismay concerning the death of Cao Shunli in hospital on 14 March.... Ms. Cao was a prominent human rights lawyer in China who had tirelessly campaigned since 2008 for transparency and greater participation of civil society in the second universal periodic review (UPR) of China’s human rights record by the U.N. Human Rights Council. On 14 September 2013, Ms. Cao was prevented by Chinese authorities from boarding a flight from Beijing to Geneva where she was to participate in a human rights seminar and observe China’s UPR. Subsequent to her detention, Ms. Cao’s whereabouts were unknown until she was charged with the crime of provocation. Her health deteriorated while she was in detention and she was transferred to hospital in a critical condition on 19 February 2014. 73 [Cao Shunli died a few weeks after she was transferred to the hospital.]

[BLUE BOX]
Sometimes advocacy processes are groundbreaking in their effects, but backbreaking in their details! Transforming bureaucracies such as governments and the U.N. and engaging in advocacy within them over time can be ardu­ous and can deplete WHRDs’ resources and energy. Knowing some of the risks beforehand helps WHRDs minimize the potential for nega­tive outcomes.
//////////////////

While WHRDs cannot predict the exact ramifications of using documentation at the global level, we
should always be aware that there is a chance of reprisals against us or our communities^74.
Alternatively, having international exposure can add a level of protection for WHRDs and our advocacy. Sometimes WHRDs are less likely to be antagonized by government actors or others if those in power know the case will be scrutinized. Sorting the question of whether exposure because of advocacy will provide protection and/or risk is a necessary part of the documentation process as defenders’ stories “go public”.


## WHAT RESOURCES DO YOU HAVE?
It is important to consider the human capacity and expertise at hand as well as financial resources available when determining what advocacy strategy or forum to use. Some fora require extensive time, expertise and money. For example, seeking justice through the courts can be a lengthy and expensive process requiring legal and other expertise in order to navigate effectively. Other options are not expensive, but also require a degree of expertise, including, for instance, working
with media. Always consider what resources allies may also have to contribute to the documentation and advocacy process, or who else is potentially doing similar work.

### ADDITIONAL GUIDING QUESTIONS

• Can advocacy be sustained in a particular venue over time? Is there a time limit for achieving the
goals?

• Will achieving goals in one advocacy area lead to more “resource-draining” work?

• Are there additional funds available to continue to use documentation in advocacy or to create
new and “deeper” layers of the documentation itself?

• What activism will need to be deprioritized in order to focus on creating or using documenta­tion in advocacy? What are the implications of these decisions to deprioritize other areas of important work?



# What are some of the creative ways documentation can be used to secure protection?

The following section provides simple overviews of common tactics and opportunities WHRDs use to
make our demands—with solid documentation at the foundation.


## ACTION ALERTS OR URGENT APPEALS

These are short letters of appeal circulated among a potentially vast network of civil society groups and individuals to pressure governments and other responsible parties to prevent or stop atrocities against women human rights defenders from occurring, or to demand a specific outcome when they have. These appeals usually lay out the basic details of a case, are fairly short, and demand a specific action. These appeals can also be sent to U.N. or regional authorities, including
the Special Rapporteurs on Human Rights Defenders or other Special Rapporteurs for their action, if U.N. or regional-level intervention is desired. The appeals are sometimes newsworthy and can be used to attract media attention to the cause.

In general, urgent appeals are sent to possible allies who are asked to write or sign letters about a documented case and then to forward the corresponding demands to specific authorities in a government. 

Petitions are similar, in that they are designed to collect large numbers of signatures for delivery to someone in authority who is seen to be able to make a difference in case. Demands may include launching an investigation into reported abuses, releasing a WHRD from detention, or creating a fair trial in which perpetrators can be held accountable. There are a number of organ-
isations that develop action alerts for cases of women human rights defenders, including the Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition, and some of its members^76.

////////////
CASE STUDY
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon, was sent an urgent appeal about WHRDs in January 2015. Launched by the Mesoamerican Initiative for Women Human Rights Defenders (IM Defensoras), this letter highlighted violence and discrimination against WHRDs in El Salvador and Honduras, and called for him to intervene with the governments of those countries to address the
abuses. IM-Defensoras asked the Secretary General to talk about these issues, and to encourage the governments of Honduras and El Salvador to “define, in consultation and dialogue with civil society, a comprehensive policy of protection for Women Human Rights Defenders that includes
public actions in recognition of their work, effective access to justice mechanisms, and an end to impunity in cases of attacks”.

//////////

## CAMPAIGNS
Campaigns can be an effective longer-term means of responding to violations facing women human rights defenders. These campaigns can be comprised of a combination of urgent appeals, solidarity messages, mass protests and demonstrations, press releases and other media work, and lobbying pertinent government officials / bodies to prevent and stop violations against WHRDs. They can involve efforts to increase the awareness of specific people or the general public about an issue. Campaigns can be short or long term, and usually have a series of goals that may shift as the campaign evolves into different stages. They also may include simultaneous strategies: for instance, they may engage the media for public awareness messages and also have a specific legal strategy that entails using the courts.

CASE STUDY

On Human Rights Day (December 10th), 2014, The U.N. Office of the High Commis­sioner for Human Rights launched a WHRD campaign that ran until International Women’s Day (March 8th) in 2015. The
campaign used the 20th anniversary of the U.N. Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women (“The Beijing Conference”) to honour and pay tribute to women human rights defenders around the world^77. The campaign focused on 12 remarkable WHRDs- one for each chapter of the Beijing Platform for Action (the document that governments agreed to at the Beijing meeting).

/////////////

CASE STUDY

In October of 2015, Front Line Defenders launched a similar campaign to highlight both the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action and current WHRD cases. Their campaign materials noted, “Beijing Platform for Action. 20 years. 12 Goals. 12 Women Fighting for Justice.” In addition to educating about the content of the Beijing Platform, the website asserted, “these 12 women human rights defenders share a refusal to quit in the face of highly gendered harassment, violence, and persecution.”^78

Goals of campaigns can include release of prisoners, a change in law or policy, building coalition work on a process, enhancing media sensitivity, or having a government or other official held accountable for actions.

Campaigning may engage activists for a few days, weeks, months or years. Generally, campaigns rest on solid documentation and analysis of abuses. During a campaign, activists may decide to continue to document in order to generate material for use in advocacy, or for additional “messaging” to support the campaign goals.

Documentation of the campaign itself is also useful as activists seek to tell their own social movement histories. Some groups or activists record their own campaigning experiences as another way of contributing to a social justice cause or to a specific WHRD case.

While campaigns on behalf of WHRDs are usually conceived of and launched by activist and social justice organizations, in certain circumstances, allies in U.N. agencies take initiative to call attention to these causes.

Generally, this is with the support and collaboration of NGOs.

## EMERGENCY SUPPORT

Support in emergency situations is most crucial for WHRDs who face imminent threat of escalating violence or who are in politically volatile environments that place them, and their families and colleagues, at immediate risk. Rapid documentation can sometimes enable defenders to access emergency support to secure safety through physically leaving a situation or locale.

In these situations, WHRDs may be relocated in a matter of hours—after those involved have quickly
put into place systems that allow those at risk to leave a country, city, or neighbourhood. Once defenders are in a more secure locale, emergency legal and other services are sometimes provided in order to help them continue their activism or to simply re-establish their day-to-day lives.

Documentation in these circumstances is usually done very quickly, and may be designed simply to
obtain the most basic facts of a case so that a defender can access support without delay. These situations often require a commitment to a high degree of confidentiality because of the immediate dangers involved, and to keeping a “low profile”, with few people being informed of WHRDs’ locations or schedules.

Some NGOs are able to respond to immediate appeals that are well documented or well argued with basic facts^79. Various human rights groups or even some government embassies can be of assistance in these emergency situations.

Educating ally activists, staff of organizations (or other entities) that intervene in emergencies about WHRDs’ experiences and needs remains critical. Even in situations of great urgency, gender sensitive processes—including the original documentation process—are of fundamental importance. Nuance about gender and the contexts of violations are too easily lost in the push to document quickly so care must be taken to maintain a proper focus on these details.


## PROTECTION THROUGH PROMOTING VISIBILITY AND PROVIDING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES: TRAININGS, AWARDS,
MEETINGS, FELLOWSHIPS AND GRANTS

One way to ensure the safety of human rights defenders is to provide visible recognition through the use of appropriate publicity. Documentation can raise the profile of individual defenders, our organizations and, consequently, our political concerns. Sometimes we have access to public discussions, meetings, trainings, and conferences as a result of this increased public presence. Awards sometimes bring a form of legitimacy and public recognition, including in the media^80. While
these are not usually what motivate documentation, it’s important to remember that one of their uses is building networks, skills and a public reputation. All of these can add layers of protection to defenders at risk.

As part of their human rights response efforts, some organizations offer fellowships to defenders so they can take time away from their regular work to pursue other projects which may or may not be directly related to their advocacy.

CASE STUDY

“Extremists have shown what frightens them most: a girl with a book.” Malala Yousafzai is a young Pakistani human rights defender with a focus on girls’ rights to education. In October 2012, in a case that immediately garnered international outrage, she was shot in the head by a man affiliated with the Taliban, likely as punishment for her blogging and exposure and criticism of that fundamentalist group. After the attack, which took place on her school bus and also injured other children, Malala and her family left Pakistan, as it was no longer safe for them to remain there. Malala has continued her activism and has sustained her critical voice as a human rights defender. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, and at 17 was the youngest ever recipient of that award.

////////////


Some groups give grants to WHRDs with the objective of strengthening their security and supporting
protection measures. Grants have been used to:

• Improve security (through the provision of surveillance cameras, bars on windows, security guards, etc.)
• Purchase equipment (radios, computers, mobile phones)
• Provide safe transport to meetings or court hearings 
• Pay for legal and medical fees
• Support evacuations to safe houses
• Support temporary relocation for WHRDs and their families to other cities or countries

The grant application process can be either formal or informal, depending on the organizations’ criteria or whether the grants are on an emergency basis.

Documentation of WHRDs’ experiences can lay a foundation for consideration for any of these kinds of
programs or for public visibility^81. And of course all of these can support the defenders themselves as well as those who are creating documentation, if they are not one and the same.

CASE STUDY
Leyla Yunus is one of Azerbaijan’s most prominent women human rights defenders. She is the founder and chair of Azerbaijan’s Institute for Peace and Democracy. Her work includes promotion of peace initiatives, projects to protect political prisoners, to defend women’s rights, and to combat
torture, corruption, human trafficking, and property rights violations. The government of Azerbaijan has antagonized Leyla because of her efforts to expose truths about corruption and human rights situations. Leyla was been nominated for a number of awards, including the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize. She has been in detention since July, 2014 in a prison known for torturing inmates. While in detention, Leyla claimed to have been denied legal representation, beaten and denied medical attention. Allies hope that enhancing her notoriety may bring about her release.
